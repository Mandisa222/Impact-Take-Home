This project implements the `NumberRangeSummarizer` interface, which takes in a comma-separated list of numbers and produces a summarized string, grouping sequential numbers into ranges.

**Example:**
- **Input:** "1,3,6,7,8,12,13,14,15,21,22,23,24,31"
- **Output:** "1, 3, 6-8, 12-15, 21-24, 31"

**Project requirements:**
- Must be Java code. Minimum Java version 8
- Must be in GitHub.
- Must implement provided interface
- Must have valid unit tests

**Note:**
- JUnit tests are included under `test/numberrangesummarizer/NumberRangeSummarizerTest.java`.
